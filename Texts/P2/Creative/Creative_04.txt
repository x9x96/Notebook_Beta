   It was a hot noon when Amina the first daughter of Mr. Ibrahim ran out of the house with the shout “My Mother Just Delivered A Baby Boy”.
   Neighbors gathered together to care and congratulate the family. They named the little boy Olumide.  Olumide was popularly called Olu because it sounds short and simple to pronounce.
   Olu began school school at the age of three (3) years old. Olu reads his book everyday. One day Olu’s father came home with two of his friends, Ahmed and Nasir who needs to eat before going back to their houses. Olu’s father woke him up from a deep sleep, although it just rained and the ground was still wet, so the sleep must be so deep.
   Immediately he woke Olu up, he sent him to fetch firewood from the farm so that Olu’s mother can cook for the visitors. Olu went to fetch the firewood quickly and his father was surprised “Olu you returned early” Olu’s father said. “You have taught me not to be lazy. You told me to be an obedient child all the time.” Olu replied. The father was so happy with Olu and to ensure that he will make Olu happy every time too.
